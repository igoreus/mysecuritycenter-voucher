========================
Task:
    Write a PHP program using OOP, which when run would generate a list of voucher codes based on a voucher type specified in a configuration.
    Configuration should be provided as a separate file in a format of your choice (php/ini/xml, etc..).

Requirements:
    While any of  generator implementations are valid, there must be at least two different algorithms used.
     It should be enough to update configuration to get a different list of voucher codes.
